# pyilc
Needlet ILC in Python


# Installation

pyilc does not need to be installed.

# Requirements

`pyilc` requires python3, [numpy](https://numpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org) and [healpy](https://healpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (and all of their requirements). 

# Basic usage

To run `pyilc`, a `.yaml` input file is required. `pyilc` is run by running the `main.py` file using python with this input file as an argument:
```
python pyilc/main.py sample_input.yaml
```

We have included a sample input file `pyilc_input_example_Fiona.yml` (Fiona to-do: change this name) which serves as documentation of the different input options. The main ones are described here.
